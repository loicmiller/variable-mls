    handles interrupts, and dumps data to a JSON file upon completion.

    Command-line arguments:
    - version (str): Print the version of the program.
    - verbose (int): Increase output verbosity.

    - unstable_part_length (int): Length of the unstable part (common prefix parameter, 'k').

    - quiet (bool): Toggle for suppressing non-essential output.
    - dump_data (bool): Toggle for dumping execution data to the data/ folder.

    - load_from_headers (bool): Toggle for loading blockchain headers.
    - headers (str): Path to the blockchain headers file.

    - step (bool): Toggle for executing the algorithm step by step, waiting for user input at each iteration.
    - print_step (int): Size of steps for printing output to command line.
    - break_at (int): Optional argument to specify the block height at which execution should stop.

    Global variables:
    - verbose (int): Global variable storing the verbosity level.
    - k (int): The common prefix parameter, i.e. the length of the unstable part.
